## Class Assignment

Create a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a point with (x, y) coordinates. For example,
points = [(1, 2), (5, 8), (3, 4)]

Write a for loop to iterate through this list. For each tuple, unpack the x and y values into separate variables. Use a conditional statement to check if the x coordinate is greater than the y coordinate.

If x > y,
	print "The X coordinate is greater than the Y coordinate for point (x, y)."
Otherwise,
	print "The Y coordinate is greater than or equal to the X coordinate for point (x, y)."
