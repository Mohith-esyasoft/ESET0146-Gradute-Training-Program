# Assignment 2

Build a React component “MouseTracker” that:

1. Uses useState to store the current mouse position (x, y).
2. Uses useEffect to add a mousemove event listener when the component mounts.
3. Updates the state with the new mouse coordinates whenever the mouse moves.
4. Cleans up the event listener when the component unmounts (using the cleanup function).
